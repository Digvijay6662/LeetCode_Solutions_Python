Hint
You are given an integer n.

Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits.

Return the number of groups that have the largest size.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def countLargestGroup(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        max_size = 0
        
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            temp = 0
            while num > 0:
                d = num % 10
                temp += d
                num //= 10
            count[temp] += 1
            max_size = max(max_size, count[temp])
        
        result = 0
        for size in count.values():
            if size == max_size:
                result += 1
        
        return result
