Hint
You are given an integer array nums.

You are allowed to delete any number of elements from nums without making it empty. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of nums such that:

All elements in the subarray are unique.
The sum of the elements in the subarray is maximized.
Return the maximum sum of such a subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 15

Explanation:

Select the entire array without deleting any element to obtain the maximum sum.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Delete the element nums[0] == 1, nums[1] == 1, nums[2] == 0, and nums[3] == 1. Select the entire array [1] to obtain the maximum sum.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,-1,-2,1,0,-1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Delete the elements nums[2] == -1 and nums[3] == -2, and select the subarray [2, 1] from [1, 2, 1, 0, -1] to obtain the maximum sum.

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a set to track unique positive numbers we've added
        seen = set()
        # result will accumulate the sum of these unique positive numbers
        result = 0
        # Track the maximum element in the array to handle all-non-positive cases
        max_element = float('-inf')

        # Loop through each number in the input list
        for num in nums:
            # Update max_element if current num is larger
            max_element = max(max_element, num)
            # If we've already added this num or it's non-positive, skip it
            if num in seen or num <= 0:
                continue
            # Otherwise, record it as seen and add its value to the result
            seen.add(num)
            result += num

        # If no positive unique numbers were added, return the largest element
        if len(seen) == 0:
            return max_element

        # Otherwise, return the accumulated sum of unique positives
        return result
