2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values
Solved
Easy
Companies
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
Output: [9,5]
Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].
 

Constraints:

2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50
1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n
For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is not equal to any of the grid members.
For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.
For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n except two of them there is exatly one pair of i, j that 0 <= i, j <= n - 1 and grid[i][j] == x.


Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        set_num = set()
        rep = mis = -1

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] in set_num:
                    rep = grid[i][j]
                set_num.add(grid[i][j])
                    
        for i in range(1, n * n + 1):
            if i not in set_num:
                mis = i
                
        return [rep, mis]


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        actual_sum = actual_sum_square = 0

        # Compute the sum and sum of squares of all elements in the grid
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                actual_sum += grid[i][j]
                actual_sum_square += grid[i][j] ** 2

        # Total number of elements (n^2, since it's an n x n grid)
        n = n * n
        
        # Calculate expected sum and sum of squares for numbers 1 to n^2
        total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        total_sum_square = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6

        # Define x as the missing value and y as the repeated value
        # Difference between expected and actual sum: x - y = total_sum - actual_sum
        value1 = total_sum - actual_sum
        
        # Difference between expected and actual sum of squares gives (x^2 - y^2)
        # Since x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y), then x + y = (total_sum_square - actual_sum_square) / (x - y)
        value2 = (total_sum_square - actual_sum_square) // value1
        
        # Solve for x (missing value) using (x + y) + (x - y) = 2x
        x = (value1 + value2) // 2
        
        # Solve for y (repeated value) using (x + y) - x = y
        y = value2 - x

        # Return [repeated value, missing value] as per the problem requirement
        return [y, x]

Solution 3:

class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        xor = 0
        count = 1

        #Step 1: Find XOR of all elements:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                xor = xor ^ grid[i][j]
                xor = xor ^ count
                count += 1

        #Step 2: Find the differentiating bit number:
        number = (xor & ~(xor - 1))

        #Step 3: Group the numbers:
        zero = 0
        one = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                #part of 1 group:
                if ((grid[i][j] & number) != 0):
                    one = one ^ grid[i][j]
                #part of 0 group:
                else:
                    zero = zero ^ grid[i][j]

        for i in range(1, n * n + 1):
            #part of 1 group:
            if ((i & number) != 0):
                one = one ^ i
            #part of 0 group:
            else:
                zero = zero ^ i

        # Last step: Identify the numbers:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if (grid[i][j] == zero):
                    count += 1

        if (count == 2):
            return [zero, one]

        return [one, zero]
