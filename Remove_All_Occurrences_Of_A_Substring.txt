Hint
Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
Output: "dab"
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
- s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
- s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
Example 2:

Input: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
Output: "ab"
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = "axxxxyyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 4 so s = "axxxyyyb".
- s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".
- s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".
- s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".
Now s has no occurrences of "xy".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
1 <= part.length <= 1000
s​​​​​​ and part consists of lowercase English letters.



Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        n, m = len(s), len(part)
        stack = []

        for char in s:
            stack.append(char)
            # Check if the last m characters in the stack match part
            if len(stack) >= m and "".join(stack[-m:]) == part:
                # Remove the last m characters (simulate popping part)
                for _ in range(m):
                    stack.pop()

        return "".join(stack)


Solution 2:

class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        m = len(part)
        part_list = list(part)
        stack = []
        
        for ch in s:
            stack.append(ch)
            # Only check when we have at least m characters.
            if len(stack) >= m and stack[-m:] == part_list:
                # Remove the last m characters (i.e. the substring equal to part)
                del stack[-m:]
                
        return ''.join(stack)
